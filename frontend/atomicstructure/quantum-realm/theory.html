            <h2>üß© Concept 1: Nature of Electromagnetic Radiation</h2>
            <p>Light and other electromagnetic radiation exhibit wave-like properties (like wavelength $\lambda$ and frequency $\nu$, related by $c = \lambda\nu$). However, Max Planck proposed that energy is quantized, meaning it can only be absorbed or emitted in discrete packets called quanta (photons for light), with energy $E = h\nu$, where $h$ is Planck's constant.</p>

            <h2>‚öîÔ∏è Concept 2: Photoelectric Effect & Bohr's Model</h2>
            <p>The Photoelectric Effect (emission of electrons from metal when light shines on it) provided evidence for the particle nature of light (photons). Niels Bohr proposed a model for the Hydrogen atom where electrons orbit the nucleus only in specific, quantized energy levels or shells ($n=1, 2, 3...$). Electrons can jump between levels by absorbing or emitting photons of specific energies ($E_{photon} = \Delta E_{level}$), explaining the observed line spectra (like the Lyman series in UV, Balmer in visible, Paschen in IR, etc.). His model allowed calculation of energy levels ($E_n \propto -1/n^2$) and radii ($r_n \propto n^2$) for hydrogen.</p>

            <h2>üßó Concept 3: Dual Nature & Uncertainty</h2>
            <p>Louis de Broglie suggested that matter, like light, also has a dual wave-particle nature. An electron (or any particle) with momentum $p=mv$ has an associated wavelength $\lambda = h/p$. Werner Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that it's impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position ($\Delta x$) and exact momentum ($\Delta p$) of a particle like an electron. The more precisely one is known, the less precisely the other can be determined ($\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \ge h/4\pi$). This fundamentally limited the idea of electrons following fixed orbits.</p>
